Here are some ACS example circuits.  Some of these will also run on
Spice and can be used for comparison.

You can run them in batch mode by typing "acs -b name" from the shell.
You can run them interactively by starting acs then "get name".  Then
play, change probes, rerun, change values, etc.

The file "runall" is a script so you can automate the testing.  Read
it before using it.

"runall.out" is the result of running "runall".  Ideally, you should
get identical results, but there are often small differences in the
machine math functions that will give small differences in the
results.  Any numerically significant difference represents a serious
bug and should be addressed.
