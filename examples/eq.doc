There a whole bunch of "eq" circuits of various types and more
are coming.

This is a 10 band graphic equalizer that I have used as a benchmark
since my early days of working on simulation.  I have it in more forms
that are not here.  By using different models for op-amps, cascading
them, and other tricks I have used it to test just about everything.
This is a working product of my design that was (and may still be)
very popular among record producers in the late 70's and early 80's.
It was designed using a predecessor to ACS on a TRS-80.

eqboost.ckt	the 1k band is boosted 12 db
eqflat.ckt	all bands are set flat
eqmodify.ckt	both.  run it batch.
eq?-????.ckt	A bunch of them cascaded to test the sparse matrix.
		Try these on Spice if you have lots of CPU time.
		ACS time growth is almost linear.  Spice-2 growth is quadratic.
		These probably won't work on a PC.
		The biggest one has over 9000 nodes.
		Don't bother with them on MSDOS.  Not enough memory.
