This "circuit" has a transfer function of 1 / (js+1).
There is one complex pole at (-1,1).
The capacitor value is j1.
It has an interesting frequency response.

The original purpose was to trick another program "zap"
(zeros and poles) into giving bogus answers.  It did!!
We all know that poles come in conjugate pairs.....
AC only!
