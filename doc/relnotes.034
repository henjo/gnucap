Gnucap 0.34 release notes  (02/01/2004)

This is a bug fix and compatibility release.

1. Fix bug causing incorrect interpolation of backwards tables.
            
2. Fix tanh overflow bug.
            
3. Fix some parsing bugs.
            
4. Fix occasional "double load" bug.
            
5. Fix AC sweep with one point.
            
6. Transient start time really works.
            
7. Fix occasional assert fail after option short is changed.
            
8. Fix memory leak resulting from failure to delete unused common.

9. Fix a Z probe bug that sometimes gave wrong answers.

10. Fix a limiting bug that sometimes caused non-convergence.

11. Configure handles isnan.

12. Improvements to logic initialization.  It is still not correct.


Some things that are still partially implemented:

1. BSIM models, charge effects, "alpha0" parameter.  (computed then
ignored)

2. Configure still doesn't handle everything.

3. The model compiler still requires too much raw coding.

4. Named nodes.  If you set the option "namednodes", it will support
named nodes, but some things don't work, so it is off by default.

5. The preliminary IBIS code is now included.  For now, it is a
standalone executable, that reads an IBIS file and generates a
netlist.  The netlist requires some editing to use, and is not fully
compatible anyway.  It is included in hopes of recruiting help in
finishing the project.



Bugs (nothing new, but needs repeating):

1. The transmission line initial conditions are not propagated until
the transient analysis runs.

2. An occasional bogus calculation in MOSFETS occurs when a device is
reversed.  This sometimes causes nonconvergence.

3. Initialization is strange when repeating an analysis without an
intermediate edit.



Hot items for a future release (no promises, but highly probable):

1. Verilog-AMS and VHDL-AMS support.
