GNUCAP 0.30 release notes  (10/29/2001)

The primary effort has been to finish the model compiler, to the point
where it can handle most modeling issues.  The second change is to
re-release as "gnucap", and add some configuration features to be more
consistent with other GNU software.


New features:

1. More complete model compiler.

2. "./configure" makes compiling more like other GNU software.


Some things that are still partially implemented:

1. Internal element: non-quasi-static poly-capacitor.

2. BSIM models, charge effects, "alpha0" parameter.  (computed then ignored)

3. Configure still doesn't handle everything.

4. The model compiler still requires too much raw coding.


Bugs (nothing new, but needs repeating):

1. The transmission line initial conditions are not propagated until
the transient analysis runs.


Hot items for a future release (no promises, but highly probable):

1. BJT model.  The model compiler is complete enough that it should be
easy now.

2. Charge effects and substrate current (alpha0) in BSIM models.  They
are computed, but not loaded to the matrix.

3. Completion of multi-rate.

4. Homotopy methods to improve convergence.

5. Transmission line accuracy and speed improvements, using a step
control mechanism similar to that used for capacitors.

6. Parameterized subcircuits and defined parameters.

7. Spice-3 compatible "B" device.
